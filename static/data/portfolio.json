This has challenged us mentally and physically and I would probably do it again :)",

So I made my Wordpress theme use sass so I could copy the shared styles from one to the other without having to convert it back to css every time.\n\nI changed the function of the menu on mobile as the page slide was a bit clunky so it's now a vertical dropdown rather than a horizontal slide and closes when you select an option.\n\nI'm slowing converting the class names to BEM (Block Element Modifier), I use it this naming convention work and I'm still unsure about it. Maybe it just takes time to get your head around :/\n\nI hope you like it.",
